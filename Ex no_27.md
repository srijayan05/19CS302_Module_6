# EX 27 C program that demonstrates the use of typedef to create a new alias name for a data type.
## Aim:
To write a C program that demonstrates the use of typedef to create a new alias name for a data type.

## Algorithm:
1. Start.
2. Declare a variable value of type char.
3. Prompt the user to enter a value.
4. Read the value using scanf.
5. Check eligible for marriage.
6. If age >= 21, print "Eligible".
7. If false, print " Not Eligible".
8. End.   

## Program:
```
#include <stdio.h>
typedef int MyInt;
int main()
{
 MyInt num = 10;
 printf("The value of num is: %d\n", num);
 return 0;
}
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program was executed and the output was verified successfully.
